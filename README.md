## This guide is designed to inform designers how to better build empathy with their development/engineering counterparts.

**Guide Introduction:**

>The gap between designers and engineers can be tough to bridge, especially in larger organizations where roles may be siloed and less knowledgeable about each other’s work.
>
>As both a full-time software developer and a part-time designer, I have witnessed the challenges of both roles, and in particular, the challenges of working together. Much like any other group of people, the spaces that divide us can easily be reduced by employing **empathy** and working together to understand each other’s point of view.
I have put together this guide to help bridge that gap, particularly for designers working with engineers.
>
>This guide is broken into what a designer should **say, write, ask, do, and not do when working with engineers** and why each point is important.
>
>I have also included **brief descriptions of common technical terms** for which designers may not be familiar.
>
>Finally, no coin is one-sided, so I have included some **tips on how designers can encourage engineers to practice better empathy** toward their design partners.
>
>*I will use the terms “engineers” and “developers” interchangeably. I will also reference non-designers, which can be engineers or other partners such as supervisors, product managers (PMs), or other.*
>
>*I will also use the terms “app”, “service”, and “product” interchangeably to mean the production-ready tool that engineers are building from the design.*
